            <p>Sorry, there was a problem activating your account. This is probably because you created the account more
                than 24 hours ago.</p>

            <p>Accounts must be activated within 24 hours of their creation. Those that aren't activated are
                automatically deleted.</p>

            <p>You should return to <a href="<?= $this->url('register') ?>">the registration page</a> and create a new
                account, which you can then activate.</p>

            <p>If this doesn't work and you need further assistance, send an email to <a
                    href="mailto:customerservices@PublicGuardian.gsi.gov.uk">customerservices@PublicGuardian.gsi.gov.uk</a>
                or call 0300 456 0300.</p>

        <? } else { ?>

            <p>Thank you. Your account has now been activated.</p>

            <p>Please <a href="<?= $this->url('login') ?>">sign in</a></p>

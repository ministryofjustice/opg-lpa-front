	                    <p>Most people choose this option because it is the most practical. While you still have mental capacity, your attorneys can only act with your consent. You will still be in control of all decisions affecting you. If you later lose capacity, your attorneys can continue to act on your behalf for all decisions this LPA covers.</p>

	                    <p>This option is useful if you are able to make your own decisions but there’s another reason you want your attorneys to help you – for example, if you’re away on holiday, or if you have a physical condition that makes it difficult to visit the bank, talk on the phone or sign documents.</p>

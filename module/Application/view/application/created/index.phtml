                <p>Thatâ€™s all we need for the LPA itself. Now you can review your LPA, pay the registration fee, print
                    and
                    sign the LPA and send it to the Office of the Public Guardian.</p>

                <h2>Review you LPA</h2>

                <p>Click below to review your LPA and edit it, if you need to. You can also print your LPA now and
                    register
                    it later. However, we recommend that you move on to paying your registration fee as soon as you are
                    happy with the details of your LPA. That way, the Office of the Public Guardian can deal with any
                    problems with the LPA in good time.</p>

                <p>When you click the button below, we'll ask you some questions about register your LPA, 
                    such as whether you're entitled to a fee reduction and who we should send the registered document to. 
                    You'll then be taken to an online payment page - or you can pay the fee by cheque..</p>

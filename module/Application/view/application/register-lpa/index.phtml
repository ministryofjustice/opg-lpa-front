<h2>How to register this LPA</h2>

<ol class="next steps">
  <li>
    Over the next few pages, we’ll ask you a few questions about things like the signing dates of the LPA.
    You'll also need to notify any 'people to notify'.
  </li>
  <li>
    You then need to pay the £110 application fee. You can do this through our secure online service.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, print, sign and date the registration form, and send it to us with the signed LPA.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Need to change something?</h3>

<p>Please don't amend any of the information in the LPA by hand. If the donor
wants to change something, they must <a href="<?= $this->editRoute ?>">edit this LPA online</a>
and print off another copy. Everyone must sign it again.</p>

			<p>It's a good idea to let people know when you apply to register your LPA. You can add up to 5 ‘people to be told’. Many donors just add 1 or 2.</p>
			<p>These people have a chance to raise any concerns before your LPA is registered, as a safeguard for you.</p>
			<p>However, you don't have to include any 'people to be told' for your LPA to be valid.</p>

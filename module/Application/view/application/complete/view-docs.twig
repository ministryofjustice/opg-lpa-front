    <h2 class="heading-large">What happens next?</h2>

    <p>The Office of the Public Guardian will send you an acknowledgement letter 2 to 3 weeks after we receive your signed LPA. It will take 8 to 10 weeks in total to register the LPA if there are no mistakes in the application. This includes a waiting period in which anyone entitled to object to the registration of the LPA can lodge their objection. This waiting period is an important safeguard and is required by law.</p>

    <p>We'll send the registered LPA and any correspondence to {{ correspondentName }}.</p>

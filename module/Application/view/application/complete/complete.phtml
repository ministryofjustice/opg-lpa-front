            how. If you

        <h2>Post your LPA to the Office of the Public Guardian</h2>

        <p>You need to send us:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Your signed LPA (all sections, from 1-15)</li>
            <li>If you're applying for a fee reduction

        <?php endif;?>            


        <h2>What happens next?</h2>

        <p>It will take 8 to 10 weeks to register the LPA if there are no mistakes in the application. This includes a
            waiting period in which anyone entitled to object to the registration of the LPA can lodge their objection.
            This waiting period is an important safeguard and is required by law.</p>

        <p>We'll send the registered LPA and any correspondence to <?= $this->correspondentName ?>.</p>

        <h2>Create another LPA?</h2>

        <p><strong><a href="<?= $this->cloneUrl ?>" class="js-clonewarning">Make an LPA based on this one</a></strong>

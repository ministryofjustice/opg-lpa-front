        <h2>What happens next?</h2>
        <p>It will take 8 to 10 weeks to register the LPA if there are no mistakes in the application. This includes a waiting period in which anyone entitled to object to the registration of the LPA can lodge their objection. This waiting period is an important safeguard and is required by law.</p>    
        <p>We'll send the registered LPA and any correspondence to <?= $this->correspondentName ?>.</p>

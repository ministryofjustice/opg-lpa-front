        <p>We'll use your answers to the questions that follow to make a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) that you can save and print, get everyone to sign, then send to the Office of the Public Guardian for registration.</p>
        <p>We'll save the LPA as you progress so you do not need to do it all in one go.</p>
        <p>If this is the first time you’re making an LPA, you may want to look at our <a href="/guide#topic-before-you-begin" class="js-guidance" data-journey-click="page:link:help: find out more about how to prepare">Before you begin</a> help page. It explains the decisions the donor has to make about their LPA and the information you’ll need to make an LPA.</p>

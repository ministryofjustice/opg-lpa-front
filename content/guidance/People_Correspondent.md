# Correspondent

The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) will contact the person named as the correspondent about the progress of an application to register an LPA. They will also send the registered LPA to this correspondent.

## Who can be the correspondent

The correspondent can be:

* the applicant (either you or one of your attorneys)
* a solicitor or other legal professional
* someone else you'd prefer to receive OPG correspondence

There can only be one correspondent for each LPA application. Unless you change it, the applicant will automatically be selected as the correspondent.

## Why OPG makes contact
OPG might need to get in touch with the correspondent to:

* give information about an application's progress
* ask a question about your LPA

The correspondent will also receive the LPA once it is registered.

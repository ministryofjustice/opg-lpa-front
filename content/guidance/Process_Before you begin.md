# Before you begin

It's important to know how your LPA will work and to talk to the people you want to be involved.

We'll save the LPA as you progress so you don't need to complete it in one go. However, you may find it useful to gather some information before you start.

You'll need the names, addresses and dates of birth of:

* the [donor](/help/#topic-donor) (the person the LPA is for)
* all [attorneys](/help/#topic-attorneys) (the people the donor chooses to make decisions for them)
* any [replacement attorneys](/help/#topic-replacement-attorneys), if the donor decides to have any

You'll also need the names and addresses of:

* the [certificate provider](/help/#topic-certificate-providers) (someone to confirm that no one's forcing the donor to make an LPA and that they understand the decisions they're making).
* the ['people to notify'](/help/#topic-people-to-notify), if you decide to have any (people to be told by the applicant when they apply to register the LPA)

# How to preview the LPA before you finish it

Before you finally confirm the details, **you can preview the partially completed LPA and download the PDF**

At this stage:

* sections 1 to 11 will be unmarked
* sections 12 to 15 will have a watermark â€“ you'll need to complete these sections online and reprint them

When you're completing a new LPA, you can see a 'You can edit the LPA above or preview the LPA' link - you can find this above 'Who's applying to register the LPA?'.

This link to edit or preview the LPA:

* takes you to a page where you can review and edit all completed details and download a preview of the LPA
* stays on the page (above the latest question) until you've clicked to say you confirm the details

If you're on the 'Final check' (confirm and pay) page, then click to edit the final question or any of the questions including and after 'Who's applying to register the LPA?', you will see the 'You can edit the LPA above or preview the LPA' link.

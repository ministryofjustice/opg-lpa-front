## Signing the LPA

The people involved in the LPA must sign it in the correct order. If they don't, the Office of the Public Guardian won't register it and your attorneys will not be able to use it.

### Order of signing

The LPA must be signed in this order:

1. Donor
2. Donor's witness
3. Certificate provider
4. Attorney(s) and any replacement attorney(s)
5. Attorneys' witness(es)

### Donor

You (the donor) must sign your LPA before anyone else.

You must sign:

* section 9
* any continuation sheets (you may have one or more copies of either continuation sheet 1 or 2)
* the statement about life-sustaining treatment on page 6, if it is a health and welfare LPA

An independent witness must then sign. Your signatures must be made and witnessed on the same date. 

If you can't sign the document, there will be an extra sheet with the LPA (continuation sheet A3) that someone must sign for you. You must be present and must tell the person to sign. Two witnesses must watch when continuation sheet A3 is signed.

### Certificate provider(s)

The certificate provider must sign section 10 next.

They should sign as soon as possible after the donor - they can sign on the same day and must sign within a year. 

### Attorneys and replacement attorneys

Attorneys and replacement attorneys must then sign section 11 of your LPA. They can sign in any order.

Their signatures must be witnessed. You (the donor) can't be a witness but your attorneys can be witnesses for each other.

If one of your attorneys is a trust corporation, they must complete continuation sheet 4 instead of section 11.

Attorneys and replacements should sign as soon as possible after the certificate providers. They can sign on the same day and must sign within a year.

### Witnesses

Witnesses are impartial people aged at least 18 years who watch you and your attorneys (including any replacements) sign your LPA. Witnesses must then sign the LPA to confirm that they saw you and your attorneys sign it. 

Your (the donor's) witness can't be:

* one of your attorneys
* one of your replacement attorneys
* an employee of a trust corporation that you've named as an attorney or replacement attorney

The same person can witness both donor and attorney signatures, so long as they are not one of your attorneys. But you donâ€™t have to use the same witness for all signatures.

### Confirming the dates
You can use this service to check your order of signing is correct before sending your LPA for registration. If you choose this option, you will be asked the dates that the donor, certificate providers and attorneys signed the LPA document.

If you find that the dates are in the wrong order, then you need to print the document again and have the relevant people sign it in the correct order before you attempt to register the LPA.

If you send your LPA in with an incorrect signing order, you will have to complete some or all parts of it again and may incur additional fees.

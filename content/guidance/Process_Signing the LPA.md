# Signing the LPA

### Sign the LPA in the right order

The different sections of the LPA must be signed in the right order. If they're not, we can't register the LPA and you may have to pay the application fee again.

Sections must be signed in this order:

1. Continuation sheets
2. Section 5 (if the LPA is for Health and Welfare)
3. Section 9
4. Section 10
5. Section 11
6. Section 15

### How to sign and date your LPA

Everyone can sign on the same day or different days, as long as people sign in the right order.

Witnesses must give their full name and address.

1. Donor signs and dates any continuation sheets and section 5 (if the LPA is for health and welfare), then section 9, followed by the donor's witness
2. Certificate provider signs and dates section 10
3. Attorneys and any replacement attorneys sign and date section 11, followed by their witnesses
4. The applicant signs and dates section 15. Don’t forget to send the notification letters if you have ‘people to notify’

### Who can be a witness in the LPA?

* anyone aged 18 or over, apart from the donor, can be a witness in an LPA
* the certificate provider and any ‘people to notify’ can be a witness
* attorneys or replacement attorneys can witness each other’s signature but not the donor’s

### Check your signing dates
You can use this service to check your order of signing is correct before sending your LPA for registration. If you choose this option, you will be asked the dates that the donor, certificate providers and attorneys signed the LPA document.

If you find that the LPA has been signed in the wrong order, you should print the document again and get the relevant people sign it in the right order before you send the LPA to be registered. [If you make a mistake](/help/#topic-about-this-service), don't use correction fluid (Tippex).

If you send your LPA in with an incorrect signing order, you will have to complete some or all parts of it again and may incur additional fees.

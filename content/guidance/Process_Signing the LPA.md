# Signing the LPA

The people involved in the LPA must sign it in the correct order. If they don't, the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) won't register it and your attorneys will not be able to use it.

### Order of signing

The LPA must be signed in this order:

1. Donor
2. Donor's witness
3. Certificate provider(s)
4. Attorney(s) and any replacement attorney(s)
5. Attorneys' witness(es)

### Donor

You (the donor) must sign your LPA before anyone else.

You must sign:

* part A
* any continuation sheets (numbered A1 or A2)
* the statement about life-sustaining treatment on page 6, if it is a health and welfare LPA

An independent witness must then sign. Your signatures must be made and witnessed on the same date. 

If you can't sign the document, there will be an extra sheet with the LPA (continuation sheet A3) that someone must sign for you. You must be present and must tell the person to sign. Two witnesses must watch when continuation sheet A3 is signed.

### Certificate provider(s)

The certificate provider(s) must sign part B next.

If there are 2 certificate providers, the second must sign continuation sheet B.

Certificate providers can sign in any order. They should sign as soon as possible after the donor - they can sign on the same day but must sign within a year. 

### Attorneys and replacement attorneys

Attorneys and replacement attorneys must then sign part C of your LPA. They can sign in any order.

Their signatures must be witnessed. You (the donor) can't be a witness but your attorneys can be witnesses for each other.

Attorneys and replacements should sign as soon as possible after the certificate providers. They can sign on the same day and must sign within a year.

### Witnesses

Witnesses are impartial people aged at least 18 years who watch you and your attorneys (including any replacements) sign your LPA. Witnesses must then sign the LPA to confirm that they saw you and your attorneys sign it. 

Your (the donor's) witness can't be:

* one of your attorneys
* one of your replacement attorneys
* an employee of a trust corporation that you've named as an attorney or replacement attorney

The same person can witness both donor and attorney signatures, so long as they are not one of your attorneys. But you donâ€™t have to use the same witness for all signatures.

### Confirming the dates
You'll need to confirm the order of signing when you apply to register the LPA using this digital tool. It will ask for the dates that the donor, certificate providers and attorneys signed the LPA document.

If you notice that the dates are not in the correct order, then you must print the document again and have the relevant people sign it in the correct order before you attempt to register the LPA.

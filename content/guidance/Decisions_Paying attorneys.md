# Paying attorneys: fees and expenses

Leave this box empty if your attorneys won't be paid or will only get expenses.

Many attorneys don't get fees. For example, if you appoint your husband, wife, partner, a family member or a friend, they may be happy to act on your behalf without being paid. However, many professional attorneys, such as solicitors or accountants, charge for their services.

Fees are paid out of your funds.

You can set different fees for different attorneys. For non-professional attorneys, these are often set as a payment each year.

If you agree to pay a fee to a non-professional, it must be specified here – if you don't, your attorney can't be paid.

### Expenses

Whether they are paid fees or not, all attorneys can claim reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, such as postage, travel costs and the cost of an accountant preparing annual accounts. Expenses, like fees, are paid out of your funds. Don't write anything here if your attorneys will only get expenses, not fees.

### Examples of setting fees

Here's how you might fill in this section if you have non-professional attorneys:

> I wish each of my attorneys to be paid £[fill in the amount here that you want to pay your attorneys] per year for their services under this LPA.

You can set a professional attorney's fee by referring to standard rates:

> I wish my professional attorneys to be paid the standard solicitor rate as set by [state the name of a relevant professional organisation here].

# How multiple attorneys make decisions

If the donor has more than one attorney or replacement attorney, they must decide how they want their attorneys to make decisions.

The options are:

* **jointly and severally** - the attorneys can make decisions on their own or together
* **jointly** - the attorneys must all agree on every decision
* **jointly for some decisions, jointly and severally for others** - the attorneys must all agree on certain decisions, but other decisions can be made by one or some of the attorneys

Each choice is explained below. If the donor’s not sure which is best for their circumstances, they may want to get legal advice.

## Jointly and severally (attorneys act together or individually)

The attorneys can make decisions on their own or together.

Most donors choose this option because:

* attorneys can make day-to-day or urgent decisions quickly, without having to involve all the attorneys
* decisions will not be delayed, or not made, because the attorneys cannot meet or agree
* if one attorney can no longer act, the LPA will not be cancelled
* attorneys can share tasks and responsibilities between them
* documents or cheques do not need to be signed by every attorney

The donor can add preferences to say how they would prefer their attorneys to make a particular decision. However, the attorneys do not have to follow these requests.

For example, the donor could say that they would prefer a particular attorney to be involved in making the decision to sell the donor’s home.

See the [preferences and instructions](/help/#topic-preferences-and-instructions) page for more information.

## Jointly (attorneys must all agree on every decision)

The attorneys must make all decisions together, however big or small. The attorneys must all agree on every decision.

With this option:

* if the attorneys cannot all agree on a decision, it cannot be made
* if the attorneys cannot work together, the LPA will not work
* if a document or cheque needs to be signed, all the attorneys must sign it
* the attorneys may not be able to use internet or telephone banking to manage the donor’s bank accounts

If the attorneys live far apart, they may find acting jointly difficult – for example, it may be difficult to all go to the bank together.

The donor should also consider whether anything could stop the attorneys working together in the future. For example, what would happen if the attorneys fell out or if one moved abroad?

The law treats attorneys who act jointly as a single unit. This means that if an attorney dies or can no longer act, the LPA will stop working, unless the donor said otherwise in their [instructions](/help/#topic-preferences-and-instructions).

## Jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions

The donor specifies certain decisions that the attorneys must all make together and agree on. Any other decisions can be made individually.

Some donors choose this option because they do not mind their attorneys making everyday decisions alone, but want them to make certain important decisions together. For example, selling the donor’s house. The donor must clearly say which decisions the attorneys must make together.

With this option, if the attorneys cannot all agree on a joint decision, it cannot be made.

The donor should consider whether anything could stop the attorneys working together to make joint decisions. For example, what would happen if the attorneys fell out or if one moved abroad?

If an attorney dies or can no longer act, the remaining attorneys will not be able to make any of the joint decisions, unless the donor either said otherwise in their [instructions](/help/#topic-preferences-and-instructions).

### Examples of instructions for attorneys appointed jointly for some decisions and severally for others

Do not use these examples unless they’re exactly what the donor wants – they need to state what’s right for them.

Property and finance:

"My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about selling or letting my house and may act jointly and severally for everything else."

"My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about investments in stocks and shares and may act jointly and severally for everything else."

In these examples, ‘everything else’ means all other decisions about the donor’s property and finance.

Health and welfare:

"My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about where I live and may act jointly and severally for everything else."

"My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions I have authorised them to make about life-sustaining treatment and may act jointly and severally for everything else."

The donor must be careful not to make instructions that contradict with their choice about who has authority to make decisions about [life-sustaining treatment](/help/#topic-life-sustaining-treatment) (LST). For example, the donor cannot give doctors the authority to make LST decisions, then make an instruction that refers to their attorneys making LST decisions.

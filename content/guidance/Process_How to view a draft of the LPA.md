# Preview the LPA

Before you finally confirm the details, **you can preview the partially completed LPA and download the PDF.**

You can download the preview once you have:

* completed all sections up to and including the 'preferences and instructions' section
* added a certificate provider

When you download the preview LPA, sections 12 to 15 will have a watermark on them.

Once you've finished your LPA and confirmed that you don't want to make any more changes, you'll be able to download and print the final version of the LPA.

The final version is the version that you should post to OPG for registration and this won't have any watermarks on it.

## Preview from the ‘Create a lasting power of attorney’ page

If you're on the 'Create a lasting power of attorney' page, the 'preview the LPA' link will appear when you're on the 'Who's applying to register the LPA?' question, or any question below that. You'll see the link just above the question. This link takes you to a page where you can review and edit the LPA and download a preview.

## Preview from the 'Final check' page

If you're on the 'Final check' page, click the 'edit' link next to 'Who's registering the LPA?', or any of the questions below that. This will take you back to the 'Create a lasting power of attorney' page, from where you'll be able to preview the LPA.

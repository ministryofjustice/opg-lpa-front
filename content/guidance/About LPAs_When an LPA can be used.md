# When an LPA can be used

## Health and welfare LPA

A health and welfare LPA takes effect only after it's registered and if you don't have the mental capacity to make decisions. Your attorneys cannot make decisions for you when you can make them yourself.

## Property and financial affairs LPA

A property and financial affairs LPA usually takes effect when it's registered. You decide whether your attorneys should act on your behalf and in which circumstances. If you don't have mental capacity, your attorneys can act and make decisions on your behalf.

However, you can choose that your property and financial affairs LPA will take effect – and your attorneys will be able to act for you – only when you don't have mental capacity. In this case, banks and other financial institutions will sometimes want written confirmation that a donor does not have mental capacity before they'll recognise an attorney's authority to act under an LPA.

### As soon as it's registered (and also when I don't have mental capacity)

Choose this option if:

* you want your attorneys to be able to help you either now or in the future with your property and financial affairs while you have mental capacity

If it's difficult to do things, you might want your attorneys to help you. For example, if you can’t leave the house or it’s hard to talk to your electricity supplier, you might ask your attorneys to deal with the bank or pay bills. You can also decide not to let your attorneys make certain decisions, for example, about selling your house.

As long as you have mental capacity, you control your property and financial affairs.

### Only when I don't have mental capacity

Choose this option if:

* you don't want your attorneys to make decisions on your behalf while you can make them yourself

* you want the security of having the LPA registered and ready to use in case you don't have mental capacity in the future

When you reach the 'Instructions and preferences' section in this LPA service, you can add directions for how your attorneys should act. Some people explain how their mental capacity should be assessed. For example:

> My attorneys shall only act under this power if they have obtained a written medical opinion stating that I am no longer mentally capable of managing and administering my property and financial affairs.

or:

> This lasting power of attorney only applies if my GP or another doctor confirms in writing that I don't have capacity to make specific decisions about property or finances.

However, if you trust your attorneys to assess your mental capacity, you do not need to add instructions.

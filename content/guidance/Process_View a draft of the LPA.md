# View a draft of the LPA

Before you finish making the LPA, **you can preview the partially completed LPA and download a PDF copy**.

You can download the preview once you have:

* completed all sections up to and including the ‘preferences and instructions’ section
* added a certificate provider

When you download the preview LPA, sections 12 to 15 will have a watermark on them. Once you’ve finished the LPA and confirmed that you do not want to make any more changes, you’ll be able to download and print the final version of the LPA.

**The final version of the LPA will not have any watermarks on it**. This is the version that you should post to OPG for registration.

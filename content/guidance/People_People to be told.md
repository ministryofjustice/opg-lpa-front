# People to notify

You can choose 'people to notify' who will be told when you or your attorneys apply to register your LPA.

## Why tell people?

Letting people know about your LPA when it's about to be registered provides extra security. It gives people who know you well a chance to raise concerns.

This safeguard is especially important if there's a long time between making your LPA and registering it.

However, you don't have to choose any 'people to notify' to make your LPA valid – it's an optional extra precaution.  

## Choose 'people to notify'

You can choose up to 5 people to notify but they can't be your attorneys or replacement attorneys. Many donors choose family members or close friends.

Talk to the people before you name them and explain that:

* they don't have to do anything right away
* they will only be notified when you or your attorneys apply to register your LPA
* they do not have to do anything when they are contacted, unless they have concerns

## How people are notified

Just before you apply to register your LPA, you must send each of the 'people to notify' a form (LP3) to let them know about it. If your attorneys apply to register your LPA, they must do the same. You can download this form when you apply to register the LPA with this tool.

The form sets out reasons why people can object and how to object.

## Where there are no concerns

If the 'people to notify' have no concerns, they don't have to do anything.

## Where there are reasons to object to the LPA

If a 'person to notify' wants to raise concerns about your LPA, they have 3 weeks to object to the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) from the date they were notified.

There are rules about the sort of concerns people can raise. They can't object to your LPA simply because they don't like it. People can only object to an LPA being registered on 'factual grounds' or 'prescribed grounds'.

### Factual grounds

A 'person to notify' can object to an LPA's registration if:

* you or an attorney has died
* you and an attorney were married or had a civil partnership and your relationship has legally ended
* an attorney doesn't have the mental capacity to be an attorney
* an attorney has decided to stop acting (known as 'disclaiming their appointment')
* you or an attorney are bankrupt, interim bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order (this only applies to property and financial affairs LPAs)


### Prescribed grounds

A 'person to notify' can object to an LPA's registration if:

* the power meant to be created by the LPA is not valid – for example, if they don't believe you had the capacity to make an LPA
* the power created by the LPA no longer exists – if you, the donor, revoked it at a time when you had mental capacity
* there was fraud or undue pressure on you to make the LPA
* an attorney proposes to behave in a way that would go beyond their power under your LPA or would not be in your best interests

### Questions to ask yourself

* Do you want anyone to be notified when you or your attorneys apply to register your LPA?
* Have you discussed what's involved with your 'people to notify'?
* Do they understand why you want to name them and what will happen if an application to register your LPA is made?
* Are they happy to be named in your LPA?

# Certificate providers

An LPA must have a certificate provider. 

The certificate provider is an impartial person who confirms that the donor understands the LPA and that no one is forcing the donor to make the LPA. 

## The certificate provider's role

The certificate provider must discuss the LPA with the donor. It’s a good idea for this discussion to happen in private, without the attorneys or any one else present. 

The certificate provider signs the LPA to ‘certify’ that they have discussed the LPA with the donor and that:

* the donor understands the significance of their LPA
* no one is putting the donor under pressure to make the LPA
* there has been no fraud involved in making the LPA
* there is no other reason for concern

Remember that the donor must sign the LPA before the certificate provider. The certificate provider can witness the donor’s signature. 
 
## Who can be a certificate provider

The certificate provider must be 18 or over and either:

* someone who has known the donor well personally for at least 2 years
* someone with the relevant professional skills and expertise, 

### Someone who has known the donor well for at least 2 years

This could be one of the donor’s friends or neighbours, someone they know at a social or sports club, a work colleague, or similar.

The certificate provider must be more than an acquaintance. They have to know the donor well enough to have an honest conversation with them about the LPA and the authority the donor is giving to their attorneys. 

'[People to notify](/help/#topic-people-to-notify)' can be certificate providers. 

### Someone with relevant professional skills

This must be one of the following:

* a registered healthcare professional, such as the donor’s GP
* a solicitor, barrister or advocate
* a registered social worker
* an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA)

Other professionals may have skills that allow them to judge whether the donor can make an LPA. Contact the Office of the Public Guardian if you’re not sure about your choice of certificate provider.

If you choose a professional, they may charge you a fee.

## Who can't be a certificate provider

The certificate provider must not be:

* an attorney or replacement attorney for this or any other LPA or enduring power of attorney that the donor has made
* a member of the donor’s family, or of an attorney’s or replacement attorney’s family – including husbands, wives, civil partners, in-laws and step-relations
* an unmarried partner, boyfriend or girlfriend of the donor, an attorney or replacement attorney (whether or not they live at the same address)
* the donor’s business partner, or an attorney’s or replacement attorney’s business partner
* the donor’s employee, or an attorney’s or replacement attorney’s employee
* an owner, manager, director or employee of a care home where the donor lives
* anyone who has a family member that is an owner, manager, director or employee of a care home where the donor lives
* anyone who runs or works for a trust corporation appointed as an attorney in this LPA
* the donor
* any other person the Court of Protection may consider is not sufficiently independent

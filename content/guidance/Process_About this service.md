# About this digital service
This digital LPA service helps you make your lasting power of attorney (LPA) online.

You'll be asked some questions. For each question, you'll need to give some information or make choices. You'll also find links to detailed guidance.

You can stop at any time and save the information you've entered. You may want to do this if you need to think about a decision or discuss your LPA with someone. Sign back in when you're ready to continue.

With this digital service:

* you can't complete the whole process online – you need to print and sign your LPA and send it to the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) to be registered
* you can only make an LPA for England and Wales – your LPA may not be recognised in other countries

You need to print your completed LPA document so that you and the other people involved can sign it. The law says that an LPA must be a paper document with handwritten signatures or marks.

If you can't sign or make a mark yourself, you can ask someone else to sign on your behalf.

## The 3 steps

1. Create your LPA and pay the registration fee: make decisions about your LPA, choose the people you want to be involved, review it and then pay the registration fee. See [Registering your LPA](/help/#topic-registering-the-lpa)
2. Print and sign your LPA: make sure that all the required people sign your LPA document in the correct order. See [Signing the LPA](/help/#topic-signing-the-lpa)
3. Post your LPA to OPG: include all documentary evidence required (for example, to pay a reduced fee), as well as a cheque if you are not paying online.

You don't have to register your LPA right after you create it but it's a good idea to. You can then sort out any problems in good time and your LPA will then be ready to use as soon as you need it.

## If you find a mistake

Once you've created your LPA online, we'll ask you to confirm all the information you've entered is correct. After this you can't make any more changes to your LPA.

If you later find a mistake, you'll need to create a new LPA. You can [view your LPAs](/user/dashboard) and reuse the information you've already entered.

If you find a mistake after you've paid the registration fee, you'll need to create a new LPA and pay another fee. As long as you only post us the new LPA, we'll refund the first registration fee.

## Fees

It currently costs £82 to register an LPA. Some people qualify for a reduced fee or can pay no fee.

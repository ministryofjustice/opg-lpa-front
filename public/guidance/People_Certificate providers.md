# Certificate providers

A certificate provider is an impartial person who confirms that you understand what you're doing and that nobody is forcing you to make an LPA.

If you name 'people to be told', you need 1 certificate provider.

If you don't name 'people to be told', you need 2 certificate providers.

[People to be told](/help/#topic-people-to-be-told) help topic has more information.

## A certificate provider's role
A certificate provider is a safeguard. They help to make sure that all's well when you make your LPA. They must confirm that:

* you understand the significance of the LPA
* you have not been put under pressure to make it
* there has been no fraud involved in making the LPA
* there is no other reason for concern

If possible, they should discuss your LPA with you in private, without attorneys or other people present, before they sign to 'certify' their part of the LPA.

## Who can be a certificate provider
A certificate provider must be 18 or over and either:

* someone who has known you well personally for at least 2 years, or
* someone with the relevant professional skills and expertise to be able to confirm the things listed above

'People to be told' can be certificate providers.

### Someone who has known you well for at least 2 years

If you want someone who has known you well for at least 2 years, you should ask a friend or neighbour, someone you know at a social or sports club, a work colleague, or similar.

They must be more than an acquaintance. They have to know you well enough to have an honest conversation with you about making your LPA and about the things they have to confirm when they sign the LPA.

### Someone with relevant professional skills

If you want to choose someone with relevant professional skills, they must be one of the following:

* a registered healthcare professional, such as your GP
* a solicitor, barrister or advocate
* a registered social worker
* an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA)
* someone else with professional skills that enable them to judge whether you can make the decisions you need to make for your LPA

If you choose a professional, ask what fee they charge. 


## People who can't be certificate providers
The certificate provider must not be:

* an attorney or replacement attorney for the LPA
* an attorney or replacement attorney in any other LPA or enduring power of attorney (EPA) that you have already made
* a member of your or your attorneys' families, including wives, husbands, civil partners, in-laws and step-relatives
* an unmarried partner, boyfriend or girlfriend of yours or of any of your attorneys (whether or not they live at the same address)
* your business partner or an attorney's business partner
* your employee or an attorney's employee
* an owner, manager, director or employee of a care home where you live, or a member of their family
* anyone running or working for a trust corporation appointed as an attorney in this LPA
* any other person the Court of Protection may consider is not sufficiently independent

## Explaining how the person is qualified
When you fill in the digital form you'll be asked to tick one of the following to explain how the certificate provider knows you:

> I'd rather they filled in this part of the LPA themselves

> They have known me well personally for at least 2 years

> They have relevant professional skills and expertise

If you pick the second or third option, the details must be written in 1 of the text boxes provided. The certificate provider must sign this part of the completed LPA document when it is printed.

If you pick the first option, the certificate provider will fill in these details on the LPA document when they sign it.

### Details to write in the box
If they know you well personally, clearly state how: for example, "friend", "neighbour" or "colleague".  This is more important than stating how many years they have known you. It's a common mistake to say something like: "I've known the donor for 20 years." This doesn't explain your relationship.

The certificate provider must sign this statement on the printed LPA, so you must write it from their point of view: for example, "I have been a colleague of the donor for 3 years" or "I've lived next door to [your name] for 8 years."

If they have relevant professional skills and experience, state what they are. If they have relevant specialist training or experience as part of their profession, state that as well.

They have to this sign this statement on the printed LPA, so you must write it from the certificate provider's point of view: for example, "I am an Independent Mental Health Advocate, certified by the Department of Health."

### Questions to ask yourself

* Has the person known you well for at least 2 years?
* If the person does not know you well personally, do they have the professional skills to make a judgement about your ability to make an LPA?
* Is the person not allowed to be a certificate provider because they have a close working relationship with or are related to you or 1 of your attorneys?
* Have you named any 'people to be told'? (If not, remember that you'll need 2 certificate providers instead of 1.)

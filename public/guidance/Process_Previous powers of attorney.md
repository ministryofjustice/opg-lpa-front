# Previous powers of attorney

The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) needs to know about any other LPA or enduring power of attorney (EPA) you've made.

Use the text box in this section of the tool to let OPG know:

* that there's another LPA or EPA
* if there is one, who the attorneys were or are.

You should give this information if the EPA or LPA was signed, even if it wasn't registered with OPG or was cancelled.

If OPG needs more details, you will be asked to send the previous LPA or EPA. Usually this doesn't happen and the names of the attorneys are enough.

If you don't have a copy of the older LPA or EPA, write information in the text box that might help OPG to locate your records. For example, a reference number or a registration date are useful.
